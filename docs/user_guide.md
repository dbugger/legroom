## Troubleshooting Guide

The most common cause of problem is when the extension is blocked by your system administrator. If you are using a computer provided by your employer or school, the IT department might decide to block all extensions that modify a Google webpage, such as this extension.

One way to check if you might be blocked is by looking at Chrome browser menu page and look for the "Managed by .." label at the bottom of the menu.
