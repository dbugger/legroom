# Legrooms for Google Flights

Legroom for Google Flights displays legroom and carry-on restrictions alongside Google Flight search results for easy comparison.

When browsing for flights, we get a listing by cost, schedule and duration. For travelers who value comfort and convenience, comparing seat legroom and carry-on restrictions takes more work. Google Flight has the information available after you selected a segment in the itinerary. Why not have the information on the search result too?

With this extension, legrooms and carry-on restrictions information will be shown on the search result! It is time to show the airlines that we care about our comfort and convenience too.
