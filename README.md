# Legroom for Google Flights

Legroom Please displays legroom (in inches) alongside Google Flight search results for easy comparison.

When browsing for flights, we get a listing by cost, schedule and duration. For travelers who value comfort, comparing seat legroom takes more work. Google Flight has the information available after you selected a segment in the itinerary. Why not have the information on the search result too?

With this extension, legroom information will be shown on the search result! It is time to show the airlines that we care about our comfort too.
